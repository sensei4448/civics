As a rule each committee deals with matters that fall within the scope of a corresponding ministry. For instance, the **Social Affairs and Health Committee** deals with matters that come under the Ministry of *Social Affairs and Health*, the **Education and Culture Committee** with matters that come under the *Ministry of Education* and the **Administration Committee** with matters that come under *the Ministry of the Interior*.
